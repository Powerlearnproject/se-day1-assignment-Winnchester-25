#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

  Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users. 
In today's technological industry, software engineering plays a crucial role in modern technology for several reasons:
 
  1. Foundation of Digital Transformation


Almost every industry—finance, healthcare, education, entertainment, and transportation—relies on software for operations, automation, and innovation. Well-engineered software powers applications, websites, and digital platforms.


  2. Scalability and Efficiency


Software engineering principles ensure that software systems can handle increasing workloads and user demands without crashing or slowing down. This is essential for businesses like e-commerce platforms, cloud services, and fintech applications.


  3. Security and Reliability


With increasing cyber threats, software engineers focus on developing secure applications that protect user data and privacy. Strong software engineering practices prevent vulnerabilities and ensure system reliability.


  4. Cost and Time Efficiency


By following structured methodologies (e.g., Agile, DevOps), software engineers optimize the development process, reducing errors, improving efficiency, and lowering long-term maintenance costs.


  5. Enabling Innovation


From artificial intelligence to blockchain, software engineering drives technological advancements. It enables the development of cutting-edge solutions that enhance human productivity and business growth.




Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

  Some Milestones in the evolution of software engineering include;
  
1.	1960: The concept of software engineering was introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference due to the "software crisis" (high failure rates and cost overruns).

2.	1969: UNIX was created, influencing modern operating systems.

3.	1970s: Structured programming principles (loops, functions) replaced "spaghetti code," improving code maintainability.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  
  The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several phases;


1. Requirements: This involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.   


2. Design: This is the practice of creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user
interface.


3. Implementation: This involves writing code and building the software according to the design
specifications.


4. Testing: This lifecycle deals with conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and
functional requirements.


5. Deployment: The release of the software to users or customers.


6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after
deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development where each phase must be completed before moving to the next whereas the Agile Methodology is an iterative and flexible approach where development is broken into small, incremental cycles called sprints (typically 1-4 weeks). Agile focuses on continuous feedback, collaboration, and adaptability.
In terms of comparing and contrasting the two models, they compare in their goals which is;
1. To produce high quality software applications and make clients happy and content.
2. They perform the same activities, which include collecting requirements, designing, developing, testing and deploying.
3. The foundation of a project involves planning, bringing the project to life and monitoring the projects progress in the two methodologies.

the differences between them however are in their execution as noted below;

1. Analysis of feasibility
   
Waterfall methodology: This process takes quite a lot of time to prevent reworking in the following phases of the project. It involves analysing cost and benefit to determine if the plan is financially, technically, and operationally achievable. At times it may lead to a business case.

Agile project management: This takes as little time as possible. You can contact clients in good time in the first stages of the project and settle the project requirements and task details.


2. Planning process

Waterfall project management: Planning in detail is very crucial and is done just once. It allows them to achieve the set goals of the project without making any alterations to the requirements or scope of the project. You can track the formulated plan at the beginning of the project in the entire project progress after it’s set the baseline. You can make no change.

Agile methodology: Not done in advance but when the team is prepared to take on a particular set of the requirements and begin to outline the development. In this case, planning is an ongoing process since the team works on an active sprint. Changing the plan is allowed, but you cannot add new requirements to an active sprint.


3. Monitoring and tracking processes

Waterfall methodology: You can monitor the project’s progress. Frequent status reviews are carried out to analyse the development. Afterward, the status reports will be sent to the management team and the project sponsors. The project managers also make weekly/monthly reports of status and share them with the stakeholders.

Agile methodology: It is different as the progress gets measured in each sprint. The project team does this, then the sprint reports are handed over to the stakeholders. Another way of tracking project progress is through the demo of the built functionality.


4. Roles delegation

Waterfall methodology: Project team members get assigned particular tasks, and one can work on only their delegated role. It is not up for any change whatsoever in the project life cycle. For example, a developer only takes care of development tasks and cannot handle any other work.

Agile project management: The teams are self-organizing and can switch roles among themselves. Or they can work in cycles, for example, a developer can assist a tester in the testing process. There is only a case of scrum master exception in which you can swap with the project manager.


Scenarios in which the waterfall methodology would be ideal is in the case of Government Projects, Banking and Financial Systems and construction software. 
Agile Methodology would be preferable in Mobile App development, Startups and Software as a Service Products (SaaS) and E-commerce Platforms.
